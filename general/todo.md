# Todofile

yeah yeah listen we gotta track stuff somehow before dote exists

## webclient/doteui

### Preliminary steps for GUI/web client

- draw UI mockup
- decide on tooling (or yknow just vanilla JS)

#### Assorted doteui implementation details

- allie: just write func signatures for transaction lib while writing ui code, spood will adapt lib code

### Goal for web client MVP

- fully functional but not pretty web client
- can use as daily driver on phone + desktop
- supports todos, notes, and tags, and properly renders their parent-child relationships visually
- client/server communication

### farther out features

- user data encryption
- client delivers reminders/notifs via operating system notifications
